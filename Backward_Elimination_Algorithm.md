Algorithm for backward elimination-
1. Select a significant value to stay, P_stay = 0.05
2. Fit the model with all possible predictors
3. Select the predictor with highest p-value.
4. If the p-value of selected predictor is greater then P_stay, then go to step 5, else go to Finish
5. Remove that predictor
6. Fit the model again with remaining predictors and repeat steps 3, 4, 5.
FINISH- The remaining predictors explains the most variance and is significantly responsible in evaluating dependent variable
